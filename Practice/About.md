This directory contains entry level practice codes for Bash. I created these small scripts with tiny code snippets for practice purposes only. Since many are not familiar with the Bash syntax, the goal is to give them an idea on what different Bash programs may look like. I have tried to include comments (starts with #) within code blocks in the files so that you can understand what variable, function or method is used for what purpose. It is not all properly done, but I am working on it as we speak. If you have any question or want to reach me, the best way would be through linkedin as I am still in the 'figuring out' phase of using github.

*If you want to know and learn more about the basics of Bash from a video tutorial, then you can follow this amazing 48 min tutorial by freeCodeCamp that pretty much covers basic Bash. Tutorial Link:*

**IMPORTANT: Note that most of these files do not contain rm commands (linux equivalent of shift + delete) inside them so you are good to run them at any given directory. However, later ones may contain rm command so it is ***recommended*** that you take a look at the code before executing.


Thank you if you have taken your time to read this readme file. Happy Scripting!
