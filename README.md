# Bash-Scripting
Entry to mid level Bash Scripting. Lets utilize the power of Bash and see how far we can get ;)

This repository contains entry to mid level Bash Scripting. At this moment, the repository contains only the Practice directory with more to be added in near future. The Practice directory contains some of the basic bash concepts for practice and understanding of the bash syntax. I have tried to include comments (starts with #) inside code blocks in the files so that you can understand what variable, function or method is used for what purpose. It is not all properly done, but I am working on it as we speak. If you have any question or want to reach me, the best way would be through linkedin as I am still in the 'figuring out' phase of using github.

*If you want to know and learn more about the basics of Bash from a video tutorial, then you can follow this amazing 48 min tutorial by freeCodeCamp that pretty much covers basic Bash. Tutorial Link:*

**IMPORTANT: Note that most of these files do not contain rm commands (linux equivalent of shift + delete) inside them so you are good to run them at any given directory. However, later ones may contain rm command so it is ***recommended*** that you take a look at the code before executing.


Thank you if you have taken your time to read this readme file. Happy Scripting!
