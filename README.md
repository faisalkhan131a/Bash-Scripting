# Bash-Scripting
Entry to mid level Bash Scripting. Lets utilize the power of Bash and see how far we can get ;)

This repository contains entry to mid level Bash Scripting. I will share the script files (with .sh extension) here so that you can just run it in your system or server if you want to. We will start with basics and small chunks of code and gruadually move towards bigger tasks where we combine what we have learned before to achieve our desired end results. I have tried to include comments (starts with #) inside code blocks in the files so that you can understand what variable, function or method is used for what purpose. It is not all properly done, but I am working on it as we speak ;) I am still quite unfamiliar with GitHub and it's functions so the best way to reach me (if you want to) would be through LinkedIn.

**IMPORTANT: Note that most of these files do not contain rm commands (linux equivalent of shift + delete) inside them so you are good to run them at any given directory. However, later ones may contain rm command so it is still recommended that you read the file via cat or vi or any text editor before executing.


Thank you if you have taken your time to read this readme file. Happy Scripting!
